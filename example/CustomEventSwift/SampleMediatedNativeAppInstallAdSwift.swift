/// This class is responsible for "mapping" a native app install ad to the interface
/// expected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK. The names and data types of assets provided
/// by a mediated network don't always line up with the ones expected by the Google
/// Mobile Ads SDK (one might have "title" while the other expects "headline," for
/// example). It's the job of this "mapper" class to smooth out those wrinkles.

  // You may notice that this class and the Mediation Adapter's
  // SampleAdapterMediatedNativeAppInstallAd class look an awful lot alike. That's not
  // by accident. They're the same class, with the same methods and properties,
  // but with two different names.
  //
  // Mediation adapters and custom events map their native ads for the
  // Google Mobile Ads SDK using extensions of the same two classes:
  // GADMediatedNativeAppInstallAd and GADMediatedNativeContentAd. Because both
  // the adapter and custom event in this example are mediating the same Sample
  // SDK, they both need the same work done: take a native ad object from the
  // Sample SDK and map it to the interface the Google Mobile Ads SDK expects.
  // Thus, the same classes work for both.
  //
  // Because we wanted this project to have a complete example of an
  // adapter and a complete example of a custom event (and we didn't want to
  // share code between them), they each get their own copies of these classes,
  // with slightly different names.
