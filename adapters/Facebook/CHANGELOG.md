## Facebook iOS Mediation Adapter Changelog

#### Next Version
- Adapter now calls adapterWillPresentScreen: immediately followed by adapterDidDismissScreen: if interstitial ads fail to present.
- For non-open bidding, adapter now calls adapterWillPresentScreen: as soon as the ad is presented, not when the FB SDK records an impression. This now matches existing open bidding behavior.
- Fixed a bug where some banner requests failed with reason "Display format doesn't match".
