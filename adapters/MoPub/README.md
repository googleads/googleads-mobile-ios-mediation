# MoPub Ads Mediation Adapter for Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS

## Prerequisites
- Xcode 6.1 or higher
- iOS Deployment target of 7.0 or higher
- Minimum required Google Mobile Ads SDK 7.14.0
- Minimum required MoPub SDK 4.10.0

## Instructions
- Add the Google Mobile Ads SDK. See the
[quick start guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/ios/quick-start)
for detailed instructions on how to integrate the Google Mobile Ads SDK.
- Add or drag the MoPubAdapter.framework into your Xcode project.
- Add the MoPub SDK into your Xcode project. You can find the MoPub SDK at the
[MoPub Github repo](https://github.com/mopub/mopub-ios-sdk).
- Enable the Ad network in the Ad Network Mediation UI. The latest
documentation and code samples for the Google Mobile Ads SDK are
available at the [AdMob Developer Docs]
                  (https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/ios/quick-start).

You can optionally register a `GADMoPubNetworkExtras` class with the ad request
to set the desired size for the MoPub privacy icon in points. Values can range
from 10 to 30 inclusive, with a default size of 20.

<pre><code>GADRequest *request = [GADRequest request];
GADMoPubNetworkExtras *extras = [[GADMoPubNetworkExtras alloc] init];
extras.privacyIconSize = 20;
[request registerAdNetworkExtras:extras];</code></pre>

## Native Ads Notes

### Ad Rendering
- MoPub has 5 assets including icon, title, description, main image and
CTA text.
- Currently MoPub adapter is built to return app install ads via
Google mediation. If you are requesting content ads only, there will be
no ads returned.

### Impression and Click Tracking
- MoPub and Google Mobile Ads SDKs will be tracking impressions in their own
way, so please expect discrepancies. Clicks are matched between the two
SDKs.

The latest documentation and code samples for the Google Mobile Ads SDK are
available at the [AdMob Developer Docs]
                  (https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/ios/quick-start).
